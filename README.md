# Ludo-on-python-using-turtle-2019-

It was made by only using pyhton, it is extremely easy and simple to understand.
Only while, for loops and if-else statements are used in it, and some amount of turtle library.



This was my first project on GUI in my life and of my Computer Science degree.
If you  want to make it as your semester project or on any other GUI library in java or python, 
you can freely contact with me for help at this number +923105396463.
